# Headphones Website
Implementing a responsive web design from scratchm from a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?type=design&node-id=0%3A487&mode=dev), as a project in Holberton.
The goal of this project is to put the skills we learned in the first month of the Full-Stack Web Development Specialization to work here (like responsive design, forms or the hamburger button).

The webpage is HTML and CSS only and front-end only.
